# MageGameWIP
WIP repository for my own game project using Unity. This repository will only be updated from time to time and is used to show off code, so there won't be any other assets included.
Right now the code isn't very well documented and since it's using Unity Engine the code might be more confusing for people not familiar with it. Sorry about that.
